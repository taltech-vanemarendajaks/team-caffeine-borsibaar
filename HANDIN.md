# Part 3: Creating and resolving conflicts 
## Step 7: Intentionally create a conflict 
- At least two team members must modify the same file and same part of the file 
- Push both branches without coordinating the changes 
- This should result in a merge conflict 

## Step 8: Resolve the conflict 
- Resolve the conflict locally using the command line 
- Make sure the final result makes sense and the project still works 
- Commit the conflict resolution 
- Push the updated branch
