# Homework Hand-in document

## Homework 2 - Git


### Common parts

* Part 1: Repository setup
  * Steps 1-2 DONE for everybody already.

  * Step 3: Initial Commit
The initial commit concerning with TEAM.md:
https://github.com/taltech-vanemarendajaks/team-caffeine-borsibaar/commit/14d0d29e282dcdc3178474a5e1ba42c7450b59c6

But this didn't resolve the whole step. The TEAM.md was describe in full after a team meeting at 2026-01-22 in PR https://github.com/taltech-vanemarendajaks/team-caffeine-borsibaar/pull/20

* Part 2: Branching and parallel development
  * Step 4: Define features
We decided each should have their own issue and they will define the feature themselves that they're working on.
